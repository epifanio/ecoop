Water temperatures are cool off Labrador and northern Newfoundland, influencing the formation of Deep Labrador Slope water, \nbut warm off the United States. \nConversely, when the NAO index is low (negative NAO state), there is a southward shift and decrease in westerly winds, decreased storminess, \nand drier conditions over southeastern Canada, the eastern United States, and northwestern Europe. \nWater temperatures are warmer off Labrador and Newfoundland, but cooler off the eastern United States. \nSince 1972, the NAO has primarily been in a positive state (Figure 1), although notable short-term reversals to a negative state have been observed during this period. \nChanges in the NAO have been linked to changes in plankton community composition in the North Atlantic, reflecting changes in both the distribution \nand abundance of warm and cold-temperate species."
